# performance-audit

> Page performance auditing through the lens of **Google PageSpeed Insights / Lighthouse**, without sacrificing layout, tracking, UTMs, SEO or conversion.

Skill built for Claude Code. Structurally inspired by the [congruence](https://github.com/xBelowZero/congruence-skill) skill — same pattern of Iron Law, mandatory evidence, explicit severity and pre-deploy decision.

---

## What it does

Performance audit that separates **what Lighthouse measures** from **what the user actually feels**, and prioritizes fixes with:

- Measurable impact on the right metric (LCP, CLS, INP, TBT, FCP).
- Realistic implementation cost.
- Explicit risk (breaks layout? breaks tracking? breaks conversion?).
- Post-fix test plan.

**It is not** blind optimization. Every recommendation preserves:

1. Visual layout.
2. Tracking (Pixel, GTM, GA4, Hotmart, AC, Make, conversions).
3. UTMs and URL parameters.
4. Form functionality.
5. SEO (meta, structured data, canonical, hreflang).
6. Basic accessibility.

## Operating modes

- **`audit`** — audit an existing page (URL, code, Lighthouse report).
- **`build`** — review code before deploy, ensuring performance from the start.

## When to use

Use **whenever**:
- You need to audit a page (landing, WP/Elementor, HTML/Tailwind, Next.js, capture).
- You're building a new page and want to guarantee a good score from the start.
- Before any public-page deploy.
- Investigating a Core Web Vitals regression.
- Investigating a conversion drop suspected to be speed-related.

Invoke with `/performance-audit` or "audit this page's performance".

## Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone into ~/.claude/skills/
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
cd ~/.claude/skills
git clone https://github.com/xBelowZero/performance-audit-skill.git performance-audit

# 2. (Optional but recommended) configure PageSpeed Insights API key
# Without key: ~1 query/day keyed by IP. With key: 400 QPS / 25k queries/day.
#
#   - https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials → create API key
#   - Enable "PageSpeed Insights API" and "Chrome UX Report API"
#   - Add to ~/.zshrc (or ~/.bashrc):
#
#       export PSI_API_KEY="AIza..."
#       export CRUX_API_KEY="$PSI_API_KEY"
#
#   - source ~/.zshrc
```

Validate installation:

```bash
ls ~/.claude/skills/performance-audit/SKILL.md  # must exist
echo $PSI_API_KEY                                # should print the key (optional)
```

In any Claude Code session:

```
/performance-audit https://example.com --mode=audit --target=mobile
```

- Security audit → `security-auditor`.
- Visual bug unrelated to performance.

## How it works

1. Identifies scope and mode (audit vs build).
2. Collects evidence: Lighthouse + PageSpeed + CrUX + code.
3. Classifies into 12 categories (hero, images, fonts, CSS, JS, third-party, WP, CLS, network).
4. Assigns affected metric + severity + priority + risk.
5. Recommends **safe** fixes, always pointing to file/line and what NOT to touch alongside.
6. Emits a standardized report.
7. Decides pre-deploy: approved / with caveats / blocked.

## Inviolable rules

1. **The LCP image never has `loading="lazy"`** — always `fetchpriority="high"`.
2. **Tracking is not touched without explicit user confirmation**.
3. **Lab and field data always separate** — Lighthouse score is not absolute truth.
4. **Mobile and desktop always separate** — they're different Google rankings.
5. **UTMs are never dropped** in redirects/canonical.
6. **Every recommendation cites file/line or audit ID**.
7. **Mobile-first by default**.
8. **Report always emitted**, even when everything is green.
9. **An isolated score does not approve deploy** — Core Web Vitals "good" in field is the criterion.
10. **Every risky fix has a rollback plan**.

## Metrics and thresholds (2026)

| Metric | Good | Needs improvement | Poor |
|--------|------|--------------------|------|
| LCP | ≤ 2.5s | 2.5–4.0s | > 4.0s |
| CLS | ≤ 0.1 | 0.1–0.25 | > 0.25 |
| INP | ≤ 200ms | 200–500ms | > 500ms |
| TBT | ≤ 200ms | 200–600ms | > 600ms |
| FCP | ≤ 1.8s | 1.8–3.0s | > 3.0s |
| TTFB | ≤ 800ms | 800–1800ms | > 1800ms |

Google criterion: **p75 ≥ "good" for 75% of users in CrUX**.
